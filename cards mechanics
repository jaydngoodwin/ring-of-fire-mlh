- card are represented as degrees around circle
- this gives an order to the circle that makes it easy to check if its broken
- there is a donut where the user can place cards without taking it
- card generate on a cirlce inside the donut
- cards are not allowed to move inside the donut

- if circle is not borken yet: 
        continuous checks for broken circle while the card is being dragged

- if circle is NOT broken:
        no check for broken circle (boolean set to circle broken)

- a card is "taken" if:
        - the circle is broken for the first time
        - OR if the card center leaves the donut (not inside)


functions to write:

checkOverlap(card1, card2)
checkCircleBroken(cards)
convertToCoordinates(card)
initialiseCards()

card: {
    id,
    degree: 0-360,
    distance,
    rotation,
    isTaken
}
